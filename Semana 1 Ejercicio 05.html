	<h1><strong>This Will be your Heading</strong></h1>
	<p>Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read, in the middle of the text you want to highlight a <b>strong statement that will blow everybody's mind</b> using bold text. Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>
	<p><i>A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business. <br><b>â€• A.A. Milne, If I May</b></i></p>
	<p>Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new generations have this things in common:
		<ol>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
		</ol>
